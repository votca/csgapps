This repository contains some small analysis programs which are written based on the votca_csg framework

# Programs

* __radii__

  calculate gyration radius + hydrodynamic radius of a molecule or a set of molecules

* __sphericalorder__

  calculates a spherical order parameter i.e. the distribution of e_r\*u where e_r is the unit vector from
  a reference molecule to the solvent molecules and u is the principle axis of inertia of the solvent molecule

* __fluctuations__

  calculate the number density fluctuations in subvolumes. Subvolumes are either cubic slabs along one of the
  sim box axis or speherical subvolumes around a solute

* __orientcorr__

  calculates the distance dependent orientational correlation function of a polymer melt

* __part_dist__

  outputs the time-averaged number of particles, listed by particle types (was a part of csg before)

* __partial_rdf__

  calculates the rdf in a spherical subvolume 

* __traj_force__

  add/subtracts reference forces from a given trajectory and stores in a new trajectory



To add your own program just create a new folder and put your *.cc files in there
